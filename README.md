# IDD-Fa19-Lab1: Blink!

**A lab report by Ben Kadosh**




## Part A. Set Up a Breadboard
![Breadboard Setup](https://github.com/BenKadosh1/IDD-Fa19-Lab1/blob/master/IDD_Fa19_Lab1_Img1.jpg)


## Part B. Manually Blink a LED

**a. What color stripes are on a 100 Ohm resistor?**
 
**b. What do you have to do to light your LED?**


## Part C. Blink a LED using Arduino

### 1. Blink the on-board LED

**a. What line(s) of code do you need to change to make the LED blink (like, at all)?**

**b. What line(s) of code do you need to change to change the rate of blinking?**

**c. What circuit element would you want to add to protect the board and external LED?**
 
**d. At what delay can you no longer *perceive* the LED blinking? How can you prove to yourself that it is, in fact, still blinking?**
Around 10

**e. Modify the code to make your LED blink your way. Save your new blink code to your lab 1 repository, with a link on the README.md.**


### 2. Blink your LED

**Make a video of your LED blinking, and add it to your lab submission.**

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println(LED_BUILTIN);
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(9, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(9, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}


## Part D. Manually fade an LED

**a. Are you able to get the LED to glow the whole turning range of the potentiometer? Why or why not?**


## Part E. Fade an LED using Arduino

**a. What do you have to modify to make the code control the circuit you've built on your breadboard?**

**b. What is analogWrite()? How is that different than digitalWrite()?**


## Part F. FRANKENLIGHT!!!

### 1. Take apart your electronic device, and draw a schematic of what is inside. 

**a. Is there computation in your device? Where is it? What do you think is happening inside the "computer?"**

**b. Are there sensors on your device? How do they work? How is the sensed information conveyed to other portions of the device?**

**c. How is the device powered? Is there any transformation or regulation of the power? How is that done? What voltages are used throughout the system?**

**d. Is information stored in your device? Where? How?**

### 2. Using your schematic, figure out where a good point would be to hijack your device and implant an LED.

**Describe what you did here.**

### 3. Build your light!

**Make a video showing off your Frankenlight.**

**Include any schematics or photos in your lab write-up.**
